# micro-os-plus-iv-monorepo

This repository hosts the collection of **µOS++ IVe**, the fourth edition of µOS++.

Strictly speaking, this is not a true monorepo, as the individual projects are maintained in separate
Git repositories. However, they are organised together here as submodules for convenience and unified management.

Maintaining separate projects is preferred, as it facilitates easier testing and enables the creation of distinct sub-sites, each with its own URL.
