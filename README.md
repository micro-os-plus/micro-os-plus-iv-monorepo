# micro-os-plus-iv-suite

This repository provides the **µOS++ IVe Suite**, a set of projects that together form the **fourth edition** of µOS++.

Each project within the suite is maintained in its own Git repository and is included here as a submodule for unified access.

Compared to a monorepo, this approach enables more effective testing and supports the development of distinct web sub-sites, each with its own URL.
