# micro-os-plus-iv-monorepo

This repository hosts the collection of **µOS++ IVe** projects, the **fourth edition** of µOS++.

Strictly speaking, this is not a true monorepo, as the individual projects are maintained in separate
Git repositories. However, they are organised together here as submodules for convenience and unified management.

Maintaining separate projects is preferred, as it enables more effective testing and supports the development of distinct web sub-sites, each with its own URL.

## Getting the Sources

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/micro-os-plus/micro-os-plus-iv-monorepo.git micro-os-plus-iv-monorepo.git
```
